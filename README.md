# HealthChat 🤖

Welcome to the Disease Detection Chatbot! This Flask application leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze user-provided symptoms and detect potential diseases or medical conditions. Built using the power of Python, Keras, and NLTK, this chatbot aims to provide an initial assessment and guidance for users based on their reported symptoms.

## Features 🚀

- **Symptom Analysis**: Users can input their symptoms in natural language, and the chatbot will analyze the input using NLP techniques.
- **Disease Detection**: Based on the analyzed symptoms, the chatbot utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict potential diseases or medical conditions.
- **Conversational Interface**: The chatbot provides a user-friendly, conversational interface for seamless interaction.
- **Response Generation**: The chatbot generates relevant responses based on the detected disease or condition, offering guidance and suggestions.
